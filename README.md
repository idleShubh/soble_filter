# Sobel Filter Edge Detection

## Overview
This project applies the **Sobel Filter** to an image using OpenCV and NumPy to detect edges by measuring intensity changes in the image. Edge detection is widely used in object detection, face recognition, and medical imaging.

## How It Works
The Sobel Filter computes the gradient of the image intensity in both **horizontal (X-axis)** and **vertical (Y-axis)** directions. The combined result highlights the edges in the image.

## Applications
- **Computer Vision**: Object and face detection.
- **Medical Imaging**: Highlighting important features in scans.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Detecting lanes and obstacles.

This implementation provides a foundational approach to edge detection, which can be further extended using advanced techniques like **Canny Edge Detection** or **Laplacian Filters**.
